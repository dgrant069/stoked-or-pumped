learning rails. this is an attempt at a sports fan page. Ultimately, what I'd like the end product to be is:
-Restrict users who can make comments and vote through facebook Auth 2.0. Only users who like certain team pages will be allowed access. There will be no other way to sign in. This is to reduce amount of trolling
-Users will be allowed to upload media, as well as vote and make comments
